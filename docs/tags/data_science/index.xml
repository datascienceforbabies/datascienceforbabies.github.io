      <description>Data scientists need to have a great understanding of slicing into dataframes because when working with large amounts of data, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know how to select certain rows, columns, or cells. For example, when working with a big dataset of real estate sales in the last year, you might want to select only the first 100 rows, or only a few particular columns. This article will explain the basic syntax of slicing rows.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between standard error and standard deviation? Every new data scientist asks this question of themselves. Honestly, the difference is nuanced, and standard error is a form of standard deviation.
Standard Deviation is a measure of the variability within a sample - this can be a sample of a population or the entire population itself. A lower standard deviation indicates that values in a distribution tend closer toward the mean of that distribution, while high standard deviation suggests that values are dispersed more greatly from the mean.</description>
